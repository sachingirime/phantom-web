## Overview

The PHANTOM project is an advanced platform designed for the detection and quantification of methane emissions using state-of-the-art technologies. By leveraging machine learning and hyperspectral imaging, PHANTOM aims to provide accurate and real-time monitoring of methane emissions, which is crucial for addressing climate change and environmental protection.

## Importance of Methane

Methane (CH₄) is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential significantly higher than carbon dioxide (CO₂) over a short time frame. It is responsible for approximately 25% of the current global warming. Understanding and monitoring methane emissions is vital for:

- **Climate Change Mitigation**: Reducing methane emissions can have an immediate impact on slowing climate change.
- **Air Quality Improvement**: Methane contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone, a harmful air pollutant.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Identifying and reducing methane leaks in the energy sector can lead to more efficient energy use.
