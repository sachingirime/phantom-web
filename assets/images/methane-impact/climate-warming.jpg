This image illustrates the significant impact of methane on climate warming, highlighting its role as a potent greenhouse gas. Methane is over 25 times more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere over a 100-year period, making it a critical target for climate change mitigation efforts. 

### Importance of Methane
Methane (CH4) is a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to global warming. Its sources include natural processes and human activities such as agriculture, landfills, and fossil fuel extraction. Reducing methane emissions is essential for achieving climate goals and improving air quality.

### Current Technologies for Measuring Methane Emissions
1. **Carbon Mapper**: This satellite-based technology provides high-resolution data on methane emissions, enabling targeted interventions and policy-making.
2. **MethaneSat**: A dedicated satellite mission designed to monitor methane emissions globally, offering insights into emission sources and trends.
3. **GHGSat**: This technology uses satellites to detect greenhouse gas emissions from industrial facilities, providing real-time data for regulatory compliance and environmental monitoring.
