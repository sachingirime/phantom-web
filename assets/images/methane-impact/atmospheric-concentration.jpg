The atmospheric concentration of methane is a critical factor in understanding its impact on climate change. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential many times greater than that of carbon dioxide over a short time frame. Monitoring its concentration in the atmosphere is essential for effective climate action.

### Importance of Methane

Methane (CH4) is a significant contributor to climate change, accounting for approximately 25% of the global warming we experience today. Its sources include:

- **Fossil Fuel Production**: Methane is released during the extraction and transportation of oil and natural gas.
- **Agriculture**: Livestock digestion and manure management produce substantial methane emissions.
- **Landfills**: Decomposition of organic waste in landfills generates methane.

### Current Technologies for Measuring Methane Emissions

1. **Carbon Mapper**: This satellite-based technology provides high-resolution data on methane emissions, allowing for precise tracking of emission sources and trends over time.

2. **MethaneSat**: Designed to monitor methane emissions globally, MethaneSat uses advanced sensors to detect and quantify methane leaks from various sources, including oil and gas operations.

3. **GHGSat**: This technology focuses on satellite-based monitoring of greenhouse gases, including methane, providing valuable insights into emissions from industrial sites.
