Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential significantly higher than that of carbon dioxide over a short time frame. Understanding the various sources of methane emissions is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. 

### Importance of Methane
Methane emissions primarily originate from:
- **Agriculture**: Livestock digestion and manure management contribute significantly to methane emissions.
- **Landfills**: Decomposition of organic waste in landfills produces methane.
- **Fossil Fuels**: Extraction, processing, and transportation of natural gas and oil release methane into the atmosphere.
- **Wetlands**: Natural wetlands are a significant source of methane due to anaerobic decomposition.

### Current Technologies for Measuring Emissions
1. **Carbon Mapper**: Utilizes advanced satellite technology to detect and quantify methane emissions from various sources, providing high-resolution data for effective monitoring.
2. **MethaneSat**: A dedicated satellite mission designed to monitor methane emissions globally, offering insights into emission trends and hotspots.
3. **GHGSat**: Provides satellite-based monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions, focusing on industrial sources and offering real-time data for regulatory compliance.
